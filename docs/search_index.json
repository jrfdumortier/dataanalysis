To use functions associated with a particular package, click ``Install in the packages window of RStudio and type in the name of the package. Or alternatively, use install.packages(\"ggplot2\") To use a package, you have to activate it by either checking the box in the window Packages or by including library(packagename). Those packages are updated on a regular basis by users. The \\# allows you to include comments in your script file that are not read by R. It is good practice to start any new script with clearing the memory using the command rm(list=ls()). Use the command get() to determine the current working directory or set the new working directory with the command setwd(), e.g., setwd(\"E:/\").

The following R packages are needed for this chapter: car, lmtest, orcutt, and sandwich. "],["heteroscedasticity.html", "6.1 Heteroscedasticity", " 6.1 Heteroscedasticity A key assumption of the OLS model is homoscedasticity error terms. That is, the error variance is constant: \\[Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\] With heteroscedasticity, the variance of the error term is not constant: \\[Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma_i^2\\] For a bivariate regression model with heteroscedastic data, it can be shown that \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sum x_i^2 \\sigma_i^2}{(\\sum x_i^2)^2}\\] This is different from the variance of the coefficient estimate under homoscedasticity: \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum x_i^2}\\] Unbiasedness of the OLS estimator is not affected but the variance of \\(\\beta_1\\) will be larger compared to other estimators. Note that the measure of \\(R^2\\) is unaffected by heteroscedasticity. Homoscedasticity is needed to justify the t-test, F-test, and confidence intervals. The F-statistic does no longer have an F-distribution. In short, hypothesis tests on the \\(\\beta\\)-coefficients are no longer valid. If \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) was known, the use of a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model would be appropriate: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Dividing both sides by the known variance: \\[\\frac{y_i}{\\sigma_i}=\\beta_0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i}+\\beta_1 \\frac{x_i}{\\sigma_i}+\\frac{\\epsilon_i}{\\sigma_i}\\] If \\(\\epsilon^*_i = \\epsilon_i / \\sigma_i\\), then it can be shown that \\(Var(\\epsilon^*_i)=1\\), i.e., constant. Under the usual OLS model: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N e_i^2=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(y_i-\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\cdot x_i \\right)^2\\] Under GLS model: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i e_i^2= \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\left(y_i-\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\cdot x_i \\right)^2\\] That is, GLS minimizes the weighted sum of the residual squares. Since in reality, the variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is not known, other techniques have to be employed to obtain so-called heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) standard errors. But first, two tests are introduced to detect heteroscedasticity. 6.1.1 Detecting Heteroscedasticity Two test are presented to detect heteroscedasticity: Goldfeld-Quandt Test (1965) Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey Test (1979) The steps necessary for the Goldfeld-Quandt Test are as follows: Sort observations by ascending order of the dependent variable. Pick C as the number of central observations to drop in the middle of the dependent variable. Run two separate regression equations, i.e., with the lower and upper part. Compute \\[\\lambda = \\frac{RSS_2/df}{RSS_1/df}\\] \\(\\lambda\\) follows an F-distribution. The Goldfeld-Quandt Test can be illustrated with gqtestdata. In a first step, the data is separated into two groups with \\(C=6\\). In a second step, both groups are used to run a regression. And lastly, \\(\\lambda\\) is calculated. gqtestdata1 = gqtestdata[1:22,] gqtestdata2 = gqtestdata[29:50,] bhat1 = lm(price_r~sqft_r,data=gqtestdata1) bhat2 = lm(price_r~sqft_r,data=gqtestdata2) lambda = sum(bhat2$residuals^2)/sum(bhat1$residuals^2) Of course, there is also a function in R called gqtest which simplifies the procedure. library(lmtest) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) gqtest(bhat,fraction = 6) ## ## Goldfeld-Quandt test ## ## data: bhat ## GQ = 5.9092, df1 = 20, df2 = 20, p-value = 0.0001054 ## alternative hypothesis: variance increases from segment 1 to 2 In any case, the hypothesis of homoscedasticity is rejected for gqtestdata. The Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey Test is an alternative and does not rely on choosing C as the number of central observations to be dropped. The steps include the following: Run a regular OLS model and obtain the residuals. Calculate \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N e^2_i}{N}\\] Construct the variable \\(p_i\\) as follows: \\(p_i = e^2_i / \\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) Regress \\(p_i\\) on the Xs as follows \\[p_i = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\cdot x_{i1}+\\alpha_2 \\cdot x_{i2} + \\dots\\] Obtain the explained sum of squares (ESS) and define \\(\\Theta = 0.5 \\cdot ESS\\). Then \\(\\Theta \\sim \\chi^2_{m-1}\\). The much simpler procedure is to use the function bptest() in R. library(lmtest) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) bptest(bhat) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: bhat ## BP = 9.5303, df = 1, p-value = 0.002021 6.1.2 Correcting Heteroscedasticity To correct for heteroscedasticity, robust standard errors must be obtained. library(sandwich) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) summary(bhat) vcov = vcovHC(bhat) coeftest(bhat,vcov.=vcov) Note that there are multiple variations to calculate the standard error and thus, it is possible for slight variations among the results from different packages. \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2 e_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\] The square root of the following equation is called heteroscedastic robust standard error: \\[\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{r}^2_{ij} e_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\] Standard errors can be either larger or smaller. Note that in this example, we do not know whether heteroscedasticity is present or not. "],["multicollinearity.html", "6.2 Multicollinearity", " 6.2 Multicollinearity Multicollinearity describes the situation in which two or more independent variables are linearly related. Under perfect multicollinearity: \\[\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2 + \\dots +\\lambda_k x_k = 0\\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) are constants that are not all zero simultaneously. For example, consider \\(x_1=\\{8,12,15,17\\}\\), \\(x_2=\\{24,36,45,51\\}\\), and \\(x_3=\\{2,3,3.75,4.25\\}\\). In this case, \\(\\lambda_1=1\\), \\(\\lambda_2=-1/5\\), and \\(\\lambda_3=2\\). Note, multicollinearity refers to linear relationships! Including a squared or cubed term is not an issue of multicollinearity. It can be shown that the variance of the estimator increases in the presence of multicollinearity. There are various indications that the data suffers from multicollinearity: High \\(R^2\\) but few significant variables Fail to reject the hypothesis for H\\(_0\\): \\(\\beta_i=0\\) based on t-values but rejection all slopes being simultaneously zero based on F-test. High correlation among explanatory variables Variation of statistically significant variables between models. 6.2.1 Variance Inflated Factors (VIF) Identifies possible correlation among multiple independent variables and not just two as in the case of a simple correlation coefficient. Consider the model: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\epsilon_i\\] The estimated variances of the coefficient \\(\\beta_k\\) is written as \\[Var(\\beta_k)^* = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{ik}-\\bar{x}_k)^2}\\] Without any multicollinearity, this variance is minimized. If some some independent variables are correlated with the independent variable \\(k\\), then \\[Var(\\beta_k) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{ik}-\\bar{x}_k)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-R^2_k}\\] where \\(R^2_k\\) is the \\(R^2\\) if variable \\(x_k\\) is taken as the dependent variable. The VIF can be written as \\[\\frac{Var(\\beta_k)}{Var(\\beta_k)^*}=\\frac{1}{1-R^2_k}\\] If \\(VIF=1\\), then there is no relationship between the variable \\(x_k\\) and the remaining independent variables. Otherwise, \\(VIF&gt;1\\). In general, the interpretation is as follows: VIF of 4 warrants attention VIF of 10 indicates a serious problem. 6.2.2 Examples To illustrate the concept of multicollinearity, the data set from nfl is used (Berri et al. (2011)). The first model includes total salary as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: prior season passing yards, pass attempts, experience (squared) in the league, draft round pick, veteran (more than 3 years in the league), pro bowl appearance, and facial symmetry. bhat = lm(log(total)~yards+att+exp+exp2+draft1+draft2+veteran+changeteam+pbowlever+symm,data=nfl) summary(bhat) After estimating the results, the function vif() from the package car is used: library(car) vif(bhat) ## yards att exp exp2 draft1 draft2 veteran changeteam pbowlever symm ## 32.547700 30.920282 39.889877 26.715342 1.621048 1.228091 5.253525 1.194254 1.581753 1.056661 The results indicate multicollinearity for yards, att, and experience. Passings yards and attempts may be correlated and thus, one of them (att) is dropped. bhat = lm(log(total)~yards+exp+exp2+draft1+draft2+veteran+changeteam+pbowlever+symm,data=nfl) summary(bhat) vif(bhat) ## yards exp exp2 draft1 draft2 veteran changeteam pbowlever symm ## 1.460849 39.339639 26.162804 1.616171 1.227479 5.253502 1.141435 1.569621 1.052906 This improves the estimation but experience (and its squared term) are still problematic.

The issue usually arises if there is a time component in the data. Recall the main types of data available for research: Cross-sectional data (multiple observations at same time point) Time series data (one variable observed over time) Pooled data (multiple observations at different time points) Panel data (same observations at different time points) There is a distinction between serial correlation and autocorrelation: Serial correlation: Correlation between two series Autocorrelation: Correlation with lagged variables The OLS estimator is still unbiased but there is no longer minimum variance since \\(E(\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j) \\neq 0\\). Autocorrelation is unlikely for cross-sectional data except in the case of spatial auto-correlation. One cause of autocorrelation could be inertia in economic variables. For example, variables such as income, production, or employment increase after a recession. But there are a number of other reasons for autocorrelation. Autocorrelation could be caused by specification bias due to excluded variables or incorrect functional forms. For example, assume that the correct equation is \\[q_{beef}=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot p_{beef}+\\beta_2 \\cdot p_{income} + \\beta_3 \\cdot p_{pork}+\\epsilon_t\\] The estimated equation is: \\[q_{beef}=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot p_{beef}+\\beta_2 \\cdot p_{income}+\\upsilon_t\\] The error terms in both equations are denoted \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\upsilon_t\\), respectively. This results in a systematic patters of \\(\\upsilon_t\\): \\[\\upsilon_t= \\beta_3 \\cdot p_{pork}+\\epsilon_t\\] Correlation between the error terms can also be caused by specifying an incorrect functional form. Assume that the correct equation is written as follows: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 \\cdot x_i +\\beta_2 \\cdot x_i^2 +\\epsilon_i\\] But the estimated equation is \\[y_i = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_i +\\epsilon_i\\] Serial correlation is caused by lagged terms in the regression equation: \\[consumption_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot income_t+\\beta_3 \\cdot consumption_{t-1}+\\epsilon_t\\] The issues of lagged terms will be covered in the part on dynamic regression and time series and this section serves only as an introduction to first-order autoregressive schemes. Consider the model: \\[y_t=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_t + \\upsilon_t\\] Assume the following form of \\(\\upsilon\\): \\[\\upsilon_t = \\rho \\cdot \\upsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\] his is called a first-order autoregressive AR(1) scheme. An AR(2) would be written as \\[\\upsilon_t = \\rho_1 \\cdot \\upsilon_{t-1} + \\rho_2 \\cdot \\upsilon_{t-2} + \\epsilon_t\\] This can be illustrated with simulated data.

Consider the following outcomes of interest: Is a person in the labor force? Will an individual vote yes on a particular issue? Did a person watch the last Super Bowl? Have you purchased a new car in the past year Did you do any charitable contributions in the past year? Did you vote during the last election? Does an individual recidivate after being released from prison? For those questions, the dependent variable is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes). For binary choice models, the outcome is interpreted as a probability, i.e., what is the probability of a person to answer yes to those questions. In the next chapter, the model is expanded to consider more than binary outcomes. Those models include categorical dependent variable that are either naturally ordered or have no ordering. Examples of naturally ordered categorical variables are: Level of happiness: Very happy, happy, ok, or sad. Intention to get a COIVID-19 vaccine: Definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, or definitely no Two examples about categorical dependent variable which have no ordering are: Commute to campus: Bike, car, walk, or bus Voter registration: Democrat, Republican, or independent For all those models, the outcome of interest is the probability to fall into a particular category. For binary choice models which are considered in this chapter, the outcome of interest is the probability to fall into the 1 (yes) category. For binary choice models, y takes one of two values: 0 or 1. And the model will specify \\(Pr(y=1|x)\\) where x are the independent variables. Consider the decision to purchase organic food. Assume that you have data about the income of respondents as well as information if they purchase organic food. The purchase decision (yes or no) is on the vertical axis and the income is on the horizontal axis. Remember that the probability has be bounded between 0 and 1. Hence, we need to find a function \\(G(z)\\) such that \\(0 \\leq G(z) \\leq 1\\) for all values of \\(z\\) and \\(P(y=1|x)=G(z)\\). Popular choices for \\(G(z)\\) are the cumulative normal distribution function (Probit Model) and the logistic function (Logit Model). For what follows, let \\(z=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k\\). For the probit model, \\(G(z)\\) is written as \\[Pr(y = 1) = G(z)=\\Phi(z)\\] where \\(\\Phi\\) represents the cumulative normal. And for the logit model, \\(G(z)\\) is written as \\[Pr(y = 1) = G(z)=\\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\\] The interpretation of the logit and probit estimates is not as straightforward as in the multivariate regression case. In general, we care about the effect of \\(x\\) on \\(P(y=1|x)\\). The sign of the coefficient shows the direction of the change in probability. The approximation to the marginal effect if \\(x\\) is roughly continuous: \\[\\Delta P(y=1|x) \\approx g(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + x \\cdot \\hat{\\beta}) \\cdot \\beta_j \\cdot \\Delta x_j\\] To obtain the marginal effects in R, an additional step is necessary. Let us illustrate the binary choice model using the data set organic and a logit model. The results of interest for the binary choice model are the (1) coefficient estimates, (2) marginal effects, and (3) predicted probabilities. "],["binary-choice-estimation-in-r.html", "7.1 Binary Choice Estimation in R", " 7.1 Binary Choice Estimation in R There are (at least) two possibilities to obtain the coefficient estimates in R.

The sign of the coefficient estimate for income is interpreted as the direction in which the probability changes. In this case, the coefficient is positive and thus, an increase (decrease) in income leads to an increase (decrease) in the probability of purchasing organic food. In addition, the coefficients are statistically significant. As aforementioned, the coefficients do not indicate the marginal effects though. To calculate the marginal effects, a slightly different approach is necessary. Let us first look at the second approach of obtaining the coefficient estimates and the R package mfx is required to do so. ## Loading required package: betareg ## Warning: package &#39;betareg&#39; was built under R version 4.0.4 bhat = logitmfx(buying~income,data=organic) summary(bhat$fit) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = formula, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;), data = data, ## start = start, control = control, x = T) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.8451 -0.5293 -0.1423 0.4093 1.9154 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

To calculate the marginal effects at specific points, the command margins() must be used. Before, we used the command glm() to calculate the logit coefficients. The reason for using the glm() is that it allows us to calculate the predicted probabilities. Consider the example to purchase organic food and assume that there are three new respondents with income levels $25,000, $50,000, and $75,000.

The variables \\(politics\\), \\(edu\\), and \\(income\\) are coded as follows: Estimate a multinomial logit model that estimates the probability of a consumer to purchase a gasoline, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or battery electric vehicle. Calculate the marginal probabilities as well. NHTS: Consider the data set hhpub from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The data contains information about household characteristics and some of their travel means. For this question, you will focus on the following variables: \\(BIKE\\), \\(HBPPOPDN\\), \\(HHFAMINC\\), \\(HHVEHCNT\\), \\(HOMEOWN\\), and \\(URBRUR\\). You must read the codebook for this question and learn how the variables are coded. Go to the codebook and pick Household as the dataset (drop down menu). Before conducting the analysis, delete all entries that are not complete (i.e., all the negative values). Once you have final data set, estimate an ordered logit model with \\(BIKE\\) as the dependent variable and the other variables as the independent variables. What do you conclude from the model? Home heating: Consider the dataset Heating from the R package mlogit. You can load the data set into R by typing: data(\"Heating\",package=\"mlogit\"). The data contains the choice of heating systems in California homes. There are five types of heating systems: gas central (\\(gc\\)) gas room (\\(gr\\)) electric central (\\(ec\\)) electric room (\\(er\\)) heat pump (\\(hp\\)) There are 900 observations with the following variables: \\(idcase\\) gives the observation number (1-900), \\(depvar\\) identifies the chosen alternative (gc, gr, ec, er, hp), \\(ic.alt\\) is the installation cost for the 5 alternatives, \\(oc.alt\\) is the annual operating cost for the 5 alternatives, \\(income\\) is the annual income of the household, \\(agehed\\) is the age of the household head, \\(rooms\\) is the number of rooms in the house, \\(region\\) a factor with levels \\(ncostl\\) (northern coastal region), \\(scostl\\) (southern coastal region), \\(mountn\\) (mountain region), \\(valley\\) (central valley region). Estimate a multinomial logit model with installation and operating cost as the alternative-specific variables and income, age, and number of rooms as the individual-specific variables. "],["limited-dependent-variable-models.html", "9 Limited Dependent Variable Models", " 9 Limited Dependent Variable Models This chapter covers three regression models in which the dependent variable is somehow limited: Truncation: With truncated data, the researcher does not observe values past a particular point and those values are also not reported. Examples of truncation are low-income household studies, on-site visitation data, or time-of-use pricing experiments (excludes low-usage households). Censoring: In the case of censoring, values that are above or below a certain value are replaced by that value. For example, the demand for a particular class is not fully observed (absence of a waiting list). This is also called a Tobit model. Count dependent variable The following packages are necessary for this section: AER truncreg, censReg, and pscl. Truncation and censoring lead to a bias in the estimates. It is not always clear why or if the data is limited in its range. "],["truncation.html", "9.1 Truncation", " 9.1 Truncation In the case of truncation, a certain part of the data is not observed. In the graph below, the true parameters are \\(\\beta_0=-2\\) and \\(\\beta_1=0.5\\). Values \\(y&lt;0\\) are not reported in the data. The green regression line is correct whereas the red is the line obtained from a regression model which ignores the truncation.

The main package used is pscl. There is also an additional resource with more theoretical details on the topic: Regression Models for Count Data in R. A more up-to-date version of the document may be found with the pscl package documentation. Here are some examples of count outcomes: What are the number of arrests for a person? What determines the number of credit cards a person owns? This section on count regression presents three models: Poisson Regression: A condition to use this model is the absence of over- or underdispersion, i.e., the expected value of the dependent variable must be equal to the variance. Negative Binomial Regression 9.3.1 Poisson Regression Model Recall that the Poisson distribution is written as: \\[Pr(Y=k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^k}{k!}\\] The important characteristics of the distribution is that the mean and variance are equal to \\(\\lambda\\), i.e., \\(E(Y)=\\lambda\\) and \\(Var(Y)=\\lambda\\), this is also known as the equidispersion property. The mean parameter is written as \\(\\lambda=exp(\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_1+ \\dots + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k)\\). The first examples uses the 2017 NHTS data contained in hhpub. In a first step, the data is prepared for the regression model, i.e., missing or unknown values are eliminated and income is measured in dollar terms: hhpubdata = subset(hhpub,HHFAMINC %in% c(1:11) &amp; HOMEOWN %in% c(1,2) &amp; URBRUR %in% c(1,2) &amp; HHVEHCNT %in% c(1:12)) HHFAMINC = c(1:11) INCOME = c(10,12.5,20,30,42.5,57.5,82.5,112.5,137.5,175,200) INCOME = data.frame(HHFAMINC,INCOME) hhpubdata = merge(hhpubdata,INCOME) hhpubdata$RURAL = hhpubdata$URBRUR-1 hhpubdata$RENT = hhpubdata$HOMEOWN-1 The outcome of interest is the number of vehicles based on household income, home ownership, and urban/rural household location. Before executing the Poisson regression model, calculate the mean and variance of the outcome variable. ## [1] 1.974733 ## [1] 1.387272 bhat_pois = glm(HHVEHCNT~INCOME+RENT+RURAL,data=hhpubdata,family=poisson) summary(bhat_pois) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = HHVEHCNT ~ INCOME + RENT + RURAL, family = poisson, ## data = hhpubdata) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.5637 -0.5173 -0.1681 0.2847 5.2201 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.
