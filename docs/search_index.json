Google search for ``Some topic R usually leads quickly to the desired help. Here are the links to a few online tutorials UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education StatMethods Statistical tools for high-throughput data analysis Two online resources will provide you the solution to the vast majority of your R questions. Getting on those websites is usually the result of a Google search. Statistical Data Analysis R: This resource contains the function manual for R/RStudio including all packages. Example for a function boxplot. The most helpful part are the examples at the bottom of the page. Stack Overflow: Resources for developers. For example, a Google search for r ggplot two y axis may give you the following result Note that all questions on Stack Overflow have to be accompanied by a re-creatable dataset. Besides many online resources, there are also two useful textbooks Applied Econometrics with R by Christian Kleiber and Achim Zeileis. Introductory Statistics with R by Peter Dalgaard. An additional online tutorial is Using R for Introductory Statistics by John Verzani. 3.2 Opening RStudio Work in RStudio is done in four windows: Script Window This is were you type your R Script (.R) and where you execute commands. Comparable to do-file/editor in Stata. This window needs to be opened by File \\(\\Rightarrow\\) New File \\(\\Rightarrow\\) R Script. Console window Use of R interactively. Should only be used for quick calculations and not part of an analysis. Environment Lists all the variables, data frames, and user-created functions. It is tempting to use the ``Import Dataset function Dont. Plots/Packages/Help There is a base version of R that allows doing many calculations but the power of R comes through its packages. To use functions associated with a particular package, click ``Install in the packages window of RStudio and type in the name of the package. Or alternatively, use install.packages(\"ggplot2\") To use a package, you have to activate it by either checking the box in the window Packages or by including library(packagename). Those packages are updated on a regular basis by users. The \\# allows you to include comments in your script file that are not read by R. It is good practice to start any new script with clearing the memory using the command rm(list=ls()). Use the command get() to determine the current working directory or set the new working directory with the command setwd(), e.g., setwd(\"E:/\"). For file paths, replace \\(\\backslash\\) with \\(/\\). Next, you want to load all libraries necessary for your entire script file with the command library(). It is also good practice to save your R-script on a regular basis. The frontmatter, i.e., the top of a R-script file, could look as follows rm(list=ls()) load(&quot;DataAnalysisPAData.RData&quot;) library(openxlsx) 3.2.1 In-class Exercise 1 Create a R-script file with the following components: Two lines for the title and the date (use #) Clearing all current contents Setting the correct working directory This should be a folder to which you have downloaded all materials. Installing and loading the package openxlsx. 3.3 Functions At the core of R are functions that do things based on your input. The basic structure is object = functionname(argument1=value,argument2=value,...) The structure has the following components object: Output of the function will be assigned to object. functionname: Name of the system function. You can also create and use your own functions. More about this later. argument: Arguments are function specific. value: The value you want a particular argument to take. If a function is executed without an specific assignment, the output will be displayed in the console window. Before using a function, read the documentation. Many functions have default settings. Be aware of default values. In most cases, those defaults are set to values that satisfy most uses. For example, consider the help file for the function t.test. -t.test(x,y=NULL,...,mu=0,conf.level=0.95,...) For this function we have the following default values y=NULL mu=0 conf.level=0.95 3.4 Data Management 3.4.1 Data in R The main data types which can appear in the Environment window of R are: Vectors preselection = seq(1788,2016,4) midterm = seq(by=4,to=2018,from=1790) Matrix somematrix = matrix(8,10,4) Only numerical values are allowed. Data frames By far, the most common data type in R. Comparable to an Excel sheet. More on this later. Lists Collection of objects from of various types. myfirstlist = list(preselection,midterm,somematrix) 3.4.2 Using R as a Calculator Entering heights of people and storing it in a vector named : height = c(71,77,70,73,66,69,73,73,75,76) Calculating the sum, product, natural log, mean, and (element-wise) squaring is done with the following commands: sum(height) prod(height) log(height) # Default is the natural log meanheight = mean(height) heightsq = height^2 Removing (i.e., deleting) unused elements: rm(heightsq,meanheight) 3.4.3 Creating a Data Frame from Scratch Data frames are the most commonly used tables in R/RStudio. They are similar to an Excel sheet. Column names represent the variables and rows represent observations. Column names must be unique and without spaces. Suggestion: Use only lower-case variable names and objects. studentid = 1:10 studentnames = c(&quot;Andrew&quot;,&quot;Linda&quot;,&quot;William&quot;,&quot;Daniel&quot;,&quot;Gina&quot;, &quot;Mick&quot;,&quot;Sonny&quot;,&quot;Wilbur&quot;,&quot;Elisabeth&quot;,&quot;James&quot;) students = data.frame(studentid,studentnames,height) rm(studentid,height,studentnames) 3.4.4 In-class Exercise 2 Create a data frame called students containing the following information: Name Economics English Mindy 80.0 52.5 Gregory 60.0 60.0 Shubra 95.0 77.5 Keith 77.5 30.0 Louisa 97.5 95.0 Notes: Use as the column header for the students names. Once you have created the data frame, remove the unused vectors.

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 4.2 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
