The purpose of probability theory and statistics is to explain and model stochastic processes such that predictions can be made. Probability and the application of statistics occur basically everywhere. For example, if you order something online, other products are suggested to you. Those suggestions are not random but are based on how you compare to other shoppers interested in similar items. Consider the following examples: Grades: If you take a university class then the grade you receive in the class is uncertain at the beginning of the semester. You may attach different probabilities associated with the various grades based on your knowledge about the material. 911 calls: While getting my graduate degree at Iowa State University, I was standing at a red light one morning which had a fire station down the road. Two fire trucks with their sirens on arrived at the red light and departed in opposite directions. Thus, two 911 calls must have come in at the same time requiring two trucks from the same station. The fire station has three trucks and as a public safety manager, you may be interested in the probability of more than three trucks being requested. Basketball free throws: Just because there are two outcomes does not mean that the probability is 50%/50%. Stephen Curry is the career leader in terms of free throw percentage (90.56%). Either he scores or misses, and his success rate is far from 50%. Polls: Especially before elections, polls are very popular to determine which candidate is favored. The polling results usually include a so-called margin of error which is an indicator of confidence in the results. The chapter on confidence intervals explains how the margin of error is calculated. Hurricanes: Projected pathways of Hurricanes, e.g., Sandy in 2012, produced by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) include so-called cones of uncertainty. The NHC defines the cone of uncertainty as follows: The cone represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc.). The size of each circle is set so that two-thirds of historical official forecast errors over a 5-year sample fall within the circle. Based on forecasts over the previous 5 years, the entire track of a tropical cyclone can be expected to remain within the cone roughly 60-70% of the time. It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center. COVID-19: A recent example is the COVID-19 risk assessment chart developed by the Texas Medical Association. The risk categories can be thought of as probabilities of contracting COVID-19 for the activities listed. They also updated their chart to account for COVID Risks of Various Holiday Activities. If you are working and receiving retirement benefits, you are likely investing those in mutual fund. The saying do not put all your eggs in one basket applies in this context. The figure below shows the evolution of Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares (VFINX) and the Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio (FSRPX). Although not perfectly, the funds generally move in the same direction. (#fig:INT_mf_plot1)Evolution of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares (VFINX) and Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio (FSRPX) (#fig:INT_mf_plot2)Scatter plot and indication of frequency of the daily returns of VFINX and FSRPX Both graphs indicate a certain degree of positive association between the returns, i.e., if one of the mutual funds increases, the other tends to increase as well (and vice versa). This course can be subdivided into three large topics: probability, statistics, and regression. The basics of probability provide means for modeling populations, experiments, and any other random phenomena. You will be introduced to probability distributions that allow you to model random outcomes. Probability theory is also the foundation for statistics. Statistics allows us to learn something about the population based on a sample. Sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing will be important concepts. The last part will cover regression analysis which states mathematical relationships among variables. For example, the price of a used car can be expressed as a function of model, year, mileage, and cylinders. To illustrate the difference between probability and statistics let us consider two buckets. The first bucket illustrates the concept of probability and the second bucket illustrates the concept of statistics. Suppose that in the first bucket, you have a bunch of balls of different colors: Green, black, and red. And you also know how many of each color are in the bucket. Probability theory tells you the expected number of green, red, and black balls in your hand after pulling out a bunch of balls from the bucket. It will tell you the likely distribution of colors in your hand. Statistics is different. Again, you have a bucket but you do not know what is in the bucket. Think about the content of the bucket as your population with unknown characteristics. To learn about the characteristics of the population, you pull out a sample from the bucket. Based on the distribution of colored balls in your hand, you can use statistics to say something of the characteristics of your population, that is, the content of the bucket in this case. "],["r-and-rstudio.html", "2.2 R and RStudio", " 2.2 R and RStudio Throughout this book, we are going to use the software R to conduct statistical analysis. We will use RStudio to interact with R and you can think of RStudio as a graphical user interface for R. R/RStudio has a similar data setup to Excel but instead of seeing the spreadsheet all the time, the spreadsheet with your data is in the background. R/RStudio requires that your columns be the variables and that the rows are your observations. For convenience, we are going to use Excel for data setup. For R/RStudio, there are great online resources: ETH Zurich: If you are looking for documentation about all the various functions in R, this is the website to check them. Note that in most cases, the result of a Google search leads to the ETHZ page. StatMethods: This webpage contains a lot of tutorials and introduces you to the basic functionality of R. Statistical tools for high-throughput data analysis (STHDA): If you are looking to learn how to do data visualization with the R package ggplot2, then this the web page to learn all about it. R/RStudio has several advantages over Excel: R/RStudio is set up to do statistical analysis. Excel is easy to use but has very limited capabilities. It is important for your future employer to know that you have been exposed to a modern statistical software besides Excel. You might be the one that introduces a specialized statistical software to your workplace. The advantage of R/RStudio is that it is a free and very powerful statistical software. R is a software that requires some programming and understanding of computer languages but there are almost no limits of what you can do. Getting a graduate degree should go beyond simple Excel job training and should expose you to something new. 2.2.1 Preparation for R/RStudio The next lecture will introduce you to the use of R and RStudio. We will use RStudio to interact with R and you can think of RStudio as a graphical user interface for R. To focus on the use of R and RStudio during the lecture, some easy preparatory steps are necessary for you to perform before class. Those are mostly related to installing R and RStudio and to load sample data into the software. With this document, you should have downloaded the small dataset honda.csv. In preparation for the lecture, you will load honda.csv into R and RStudio. 2.2.2 Installing R and RStudio You must first install R on your computer by doing the following: Go to The R Project for Statistical Computing and download the R version that is appropriate for your computer. This is either the base version if you have a Windows computer or the Latest release .pkg file if you are using Mac OS. Once you have downloaded the file, install R on your computer. Go to RStudio and download the RStudio version that is appropriate for your computer. Note that the various Installers for Supported Platforms are at the bottom of the page. Once you have downloaded the file, install RStudio on your computer. Note that we will only be using RStudio which runs R in the background. You cannot use RStudio without having R installed first. Throughout the lecture, I will be referring to R/RStudio. 2.2.3 Locating Files on your Computer To import data into R/RStudio, you must know (1) where files are located on your computer and (2) what the current working directory of R/RStudio is. On a windows computer, the directory where files are stored is like C:\\Users\\Jerome\\Documents\\R Lecture and for Mac OS it is similar to /Users/Jerome/R Lecture Think of the working directory as the folder on your computer in which R/RStudio is looking for files by default. After opening R/RStudio, you can type getwd() in the console window and R/RStudio will return the current working directory. Usually, you have project specific working directories. For this class, create a directory on your computer in which you are going to store all the files associated with this class. You should download the dataset honda.csv into the directory you have created for this class. You can use the command setwd() to change the R/RStudio to the new working directory. Note - and this is an oddity with R/RStudio - you have to replace the backslash with a forward slash if you are a Windows user, i.e., use setwd(\"C:/Users/Jerome/Documents/R Lecture\"). Assuming the honda.csv file is in the directory you have set above, use honda= read.csv(\"honda.csv\") to load the file into R/RStudio. The data should appear in the Environment tab on the right side in R/RStudio. It is important that you can do the steps described above before the lecture to alleviate any issues at the beginning.

Should only be used for quick calculations and not part of an analysis. Environment Lists all the variables, data frames, and user-created functions. It is tempting to use the Import Dataset function Dont. Plots/Packages/Help There is a base version of R that allows doing many calculations but the power of R comes through its packages. To use functions associated with a particular package, click ``Install in the packages window of RStudio and type in the name of the package. Or alternatively, use install.packages(\"ggplot2\") To use a package, you have to activate it by either checking the box in the window Packages or by including library(packagename). Those packages are updated on a regular basis by users. The \\# allows you to include comments in your script file that are not read by R. It is good practice to start any new script with clearing the memory using the command rm(list=ls()). Use the command get() to determine the current working directory or set the new working directory with the command setwd(), e.g., setwd(\"E:/\"). For file paths, replace \\(\\backslash\\) with \\(/\\). Next, you want to load all libraries necessary for your entire script file with the command library(). It is also good practice to save your R-script on a regular basis. The frontmatter, i.e., the top of a R-script file, could look as follows rm(list=ls()) load(&quot;DataAnalysisPAData.RData&quot;) library(openxlsx) 3.2.1 In-class Exercise 1 Create a R-script file with the following components: Two lines for the title and the date (use #) Clearing all current contents Setting the correct working directory This should be a folder to which you have downloaded all materials.

More about this later. argument: Arguments are function specific. value: The value you want a particular argument to take. If a function is executed without an specific assignment, the output will be displayed in the console window. Before using a function, read the documentation. Many functions have default settings. Be aware of default values. In most cases, those defaults are set to values that satisfy most uses. For example, consider the help file for the function t.test. -t.test(x,y=NULL,...,mu=0,conf.level=0.95,...) For this function we have the following default values y=NULL mu=0 conf.level=0.95 "],["data-in-r.html", "3.4 Data in R", " 3.4 Data in R The main data types which can appear in the Environment window of R are: Vectors preselection = seq(1788,2016,4) midterm = seq(by=4,to=2018,from=1790) Matrix somematrix = matrix(8,10,4) Only numerical values are allowed.

Consider the data vehicles. Extracting vehicle information only for the year 2015 is done as follows: cars2015 = subset(vehicles,year==2015) Note that the double equal sign conducts a logical test. This is similar to Stata. Using a single equal sign does not extract any data and simply returns the original data without (!) an error message. To list all the distinct values in a column, the command unique() can be used. This command only makes sense in the case of categorical data in a particular column. For example, listing all EPA vehicle size classes (\\(VClass\\)) can be accomplished as follows: unique(cars2015\\$VClass) Suppose you are only interested in the variables \\(ghgScore\\) and \\(VClass\\) for the model year 2015. cars2015 = subset(vehicles,year==2015,select=c(\"ghgScore\",\"VClass\")) Suppose you are only interested in Compact Cars and Large Cars in the column \\(VClass\\) for the year 2015.

"],["measures-of-central-tendency.html", "4.1 Measures of Central Tendency", " 4.1 Measures of Central Tendency The three main measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. The mean reports the average value of a data set. Sometimes, it is also called arithmetic mean or average and can be expressed as follows: \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\] The mean does not always explain data very well and there are some other measures to explore. Among them are the median and mode. The median divides the data set into two equal parts, such that half of all the values are greater than the median and half are smaller than the median. The middle term of the data set is the \\((n+1)/2\\)-th term. The median has the advantage that a very high or very low values do not influence the median. For example, the average taxable income in Switzerland is $56,805. The town Vaux-sur-Morges has an average taxable income of $670,046. It turns out that one very wealthy person (Andre Hoffmann from Roche Pharmaceutical) drives up the average in the village with 178 inhabitants. The mode is the value that occurs the most frequently. Consider the table below on the income distribution of ten citizens in three states. Note that the mean income in all three states is 10. Although, there is considerable variation among the citizens. The median is 10, 9.5, and 2 for state A, B, and C, respectively. The mode is 10, 10, and 2 for state A, B, and C, respectively. Table 4.1: Income distribution among citizens in three states.

A measure used far more often is the variance. Think of the variance as a measure describing how far the data is spread around the mean. Recall from Chapter 1 that there we distinguish between a population and a sample. The population is characterized by unknown parameters and we use statistics based on sample to say something about the unknown population parameters. The distinction between population and sample is important regarding the variance. The population variance is calculated as follows: \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\\mu)^2\\] The sample variance is calculated as follows: \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\] The population variance is used to calculate the variance of the entire population. For example, if a professor is interested in calculating the variance associated with the final exam, they would use population variance equation because the class is not a sample of a larger population. The second equation dividing by \\(N-1\\) is used if we have a sample and want to estimate (!) the variance associated with the population. Consider the figure below which illustrates the difference. A randomly generated data set contains 100,000 observations with \\(\\mu=50\\) and \\(\\sigma=20\\). An simulation procedure takes 1000 sample with sample sizes varying from 2 to 50 (horizontal axis). For each of the sample, the population variance is estimated by dividing by either \\(N\\) or \\(N-1\\). The estimates dividing by \\(N-1\\) are closer to the population standard deviation than for the samples divided by \\(N\\). The coefficient of variation standardizes the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) by the mean, i.e., \\(CV=\\sigma/\\mu\\). Because the magnitude of the standard deviation depends on the mean, it is sometimes necessary to calculate the coefficient of variation to make two or more standard deviations comparable. For example, suppose you are comparing residential home values in California and Indiana. You calculate the mean and standard deviation for California as $2,000,000 and $400,000, respectively. The mean and standard deviation for Indiana are $125,000 and $50,000, respectively. Calculating the coefficient of variation (\\(CV\\)) for both states leads to \\(CV_{CA} = 0.2\\) and \\(CV_{IN} = 0.4\\). Hence, there is much more variation in the home values for Indiana than there is in California. "],["histograms.html", "4.3 Histograms", " 4.3 Histograms In almost all cases, a visual inspection of the data is appropriate. Although numerical statistics such as mean and/or standard deviation exist, many fail to easily identify patterns or anomalies. Histograms are probably the most basic method to graphically summarize data and are also good approximations of the probability distributions. Suppose you have a data set \\(x_1,x_2, \\dots, x_n\\). You divide the range of values into bins. For example, if a data set ranges from 75 to 155, then a possible bin size could be 10, i.e., \\(75, 85, \\dots, 155\\). The height of the bar for each bin is determined by the number of observations in the bin range. Those bins usually have the same size but it is not necessary.

An important measure of empirical cumulative distribution functions are quantiles. Quantiles are the values that cut x% of the distributional area. Below the quantile is a certain share of all values in a set of ordered observations. If the distribution is divided in \\(n\\) equal shares, there are \\(n-1\\) quantiles. Commonly used quantiles are quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles. Quartiles divide the sample into 4 equal shares, i.e., 3 quartiles: 25%-, 50%-, 75%- quartile. Quintiles divide the sample into 5 equal shares, deciles into 10 equal shares, and percentiles divide the sample into 100 equal shares. Closely related to quartiles is the interquartile range (IQR).

Very often, we have more two or more random variable and we are interested in their relationship. We will analyze the relationship between variables from a causal standpoint in the section on regression analysis. In this chapter, we focus on two variables and how they behave jointly. For now, we will not make any statements about causality. The important part here: Correlation is not causation! As for the variance, there are two definitions/equations to calculate the covariance between two variables: \\[Cov(x,y)=E[(x-E(x))\\cdot (y-E(y))]=E(x \\cdot y)-E(x)E(y)\\] If the sign of the covariance is positive, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) tend to move in the same direction, i.e., if one variable increases, the other variable increases as well. If the sign of the covariance is negative, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) tend to move in opposite directions, i.e., if one variable decreases, the other increases. If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then \\(Cov(X,Y)=0\\). The covariance has several properties: Property 1: \\(Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)+ 2 \\cdot Cov(X,Y)\\) Property 2 (Transformation of the covariance): \\(Cov(r \\cdot X+s,t \\cdot Y+u)=r \\cdot t \\cdot Cov(X,Y)\\) The most important aspect about correlation (and statistics in general): Correlation does not mean causation. Causation requires a strong theoretical believe that one variable is the cause of another variable, e.g., influence of education on income. The correlation coefficient (sometimes called Pearsons \\(r\\)) is defined as \\[\\rho(X,Y) = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{Var(X) \\cdot Var(Y)}}\\] The correlation coefficient varies between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). The Sign provides the direction of the relationship between two variables and the Value provides the magnitude of the relationship. Note that the correlation coefficient has no dimensions!

Household Pulse Survey: The U.S. Census Bureau has created a weekly survey to quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how peoples lives have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The results are presented weekly (e.g., week 22 represents January 6-18). If you go to the surveys webpage, you find that you can explore the data using three tools. There is the Interactive Tool which uses a graphical user interface to display the data. There are Data Tables which represent the aggregate data in Excel files. And lastly, there are Public Use Files (PUF) which contain the original data. For this exercise, you will use the PUF of the most recent week available to do the following: Download the most recent PUF file in csv-format which is denoted HPS Week X PUF CSV where \\(X\\) represents the week. Extract the zip-file and you find three csv-files. The two files necessary for this exercise are pulse2020\\_data.dictonary\\_CSV\\_X.csv and pulse2020\\_puf\\_X.csv (no need to use the largest file). Column Variable in pulse2020_data.dictonary_CSV_X.csv describes the columns in pulse2020_puf_X.csv. Pick two variables which are of interest to you, e.g., Educational attainment and Frequency of worry over previous 7 days, and construct a cross-table (using the package gmodels for example) similar to the one on gun ownership but only include the dimensions of interest. So for example, given the relationship between worrying and education, the R-code would look like this: What is your interpretation of the results obtained in part (b)? Is it what you expected?

"],["probability.html", "5 Probability", " 5 Probability Probability assigns a number between 0 and 1 to a given event. The number represents the likelihood of this event occurring. To assign a probability to an event, we need to conduct an experiment which is a procedure to obtain outcomes, i.e., the results of an experiment. Suppose you want to know the probability of obtaining exactly seven heads from flipping a coin ten times. We will see later that you can easily calculate this probability but if you do not know how, you have to resort to an experiment. You have to flip a coin ten times and write down the number of heads you obtain. You then have to repeat this experiment multiple times. Each time you get one of eleven possible outcomes. If you conduct the experiment 1,000 times and 117 times the outcome is a 7, then you know the probability of obtaining seven heads from flipping a coin 10 times is around 11.7%. "],["sample-spaces-outcomes-events-and-set-operations.html", "5.1 Sample Spaces, Outcomes, Events, and Set Operations", " 5.1 Sample Spaces, Outcomes, Events, and Set Operations A sample space is a list of all possible outcomes of an experiment and is denoted \\(\\Omega\\). Examples of sample spaces are: Rolling a single die: \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) Tossing a coin: \\(\\Omega = \\{H,T\\}\\) Grades: \\(\\Omega = \\{A+,A,A-, \\dots, F\\}\\) Number of calls to a fire station in a 24-hour period: \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1,2 \\dots \\}\\) An event is a subset of the sample space. Examples are Rolling an even number: \\(E = \\{2,4,6\\}\\) Rolling a number less or equal to 4: \\(S = \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) More than 5 calls to the fire station: \\(F = \\{6,7,\\dots \\}\\) There are several set operations and we can use Venn diagrams to illustrate them: Intersection: The intersection \\(W\\) of two sets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is the set of elements that are in both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We write \\(W=X\\cap Y\\). Empty or Null Sets: The empty set or the null set (\\(\\emptyset\\)) is the set with no elements. For example, if the sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) contain no common elements then these two sets are said to be disjoint, e.g., odd and even numbers: $ AB=$. **Unions*: The union of two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all elements in one or the other of the sets. We write $ C=AB$. Complements: The complement of a set \\(X\\) is the set of elements of the universal set \\(U\\) that are not elements of \\(X\\), and is written \\(X^{c}\\). For a discrete sample space \\(\\Omega\\), the probability of an event is a non-negative number, i.e., \\(P(A) \\geq 0\\), for any subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\Omega\\). In addition, we have \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\), i.e., all the probabilities of the outcomes in the sample space sum up to 1. For example, if we flip a coin, the sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{H,T\\}\\). The corresponding probabilities are \\(P(H) = 0.5\\) and \\(P(T) = 0.5\\). The sum of both is equal to 1. Keep in mind that \\(P(A^c)=1-P(A)\\). It is sometimes easier to calculate the complement of an event than the event itself. If \\(A,B,C,\\dots\\) is a finite or infinite sequence of mutually exclusive events  that is events which cannot happen at the same time  from the sample space \\(\\Omega\\),then \\[P\\left(A \\cup B \\cup C \\cup \\cdots \\right)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)+\\cdots\\] To illustrate this, suppose you are flipping a coin three times. The eight events in \\(\\Omega\\) are \\[\\Omega = \\{HHH,HHT,HTH,HTT,THH,THT,TTH,TTT\\}\\] The probability of each event is equally likely, i.e., \\(P\\left(E_{i}\\right)=1/8\\) for \\(i=1,2,3,\\dots,8\\). If your event of interest \\(A\\) is that exactly two of the three tosses results are heads, then \\(A=\\{HHT,HTH,THH\\}\\). By summing up the probabilities associated with those events, we find that \\(P(A)\\): \\[P(A)=P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH)=\\frac{1}{8} +\\frac{1}{8} +\\frac{1}{8} =\\frac{3}{8}\\] Note that the same result can be obtained by using a probability tree. A probability tree has the advantage that it represents the possible outcome and probabilities in a graphical manner. "],["probability-of-a-union.html", "5.2 Probability of a Union", " 5.2 Probability of a Union For any two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we have the probability of a union (also known as the addition rule) which states that the probability of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurring can be written as: \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B)\\] If \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\), then we call them disjoint events. For example, let \\(A = \\{Alcohol\\}\\), \\(B= \\{Cocaine \\}\\), and \\(A \\cap B = \\{Both \\}\\). The probabilities are given by \\(P(A)=0.86\\), \\(P(B)=0.35\\), and \\(P(A \\cap B)=0.29\\).

"],["heteroscedasticity.html", "8.1 Heteroscedasticity", " 8.1 Heteroscedasticity A key assumption of the OLS model is homoscedasticity error terms. That is, the error variance is constant: \\[Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\] With heteroscedasticity, the variance of the error term is not constant: \\[Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma_i^2\\] For a bivariate regression model with heteroscedastic data, it can be shown that \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sum x_i^2 \\sigma_i^2}{(\\sum x_i^2)^2}\\] This is different from the variance of the coefficient estimate under homoscedasticity: \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum x_i^2}\\] Unbiasedness of the OLS estimator is not affected but the variance of \\(\\beta_1\\) will be larger compared to other estimators. Note that the measure of \\(R^2\\) is unaffected by heteroscedasticity. Homoscedasticity is needed to justify the t-test, F-test, and confidence intervals. The F-statistic does no longer have an F-distribution. In short, hypothesis tests on the \\(\\beta\\)-coefficients are no longer valid. If \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) was known, the use of a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model would be appropriate: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Dividing both sides by the known variance: \\[\\frac{y_i}{\\sigma_i}=\\beta_0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i}+\\beta_1 \\frac{x_i}{\\sigma_i}+\\frac{\\epsilon_i}{\\sigma_i}\\] If \\(\\epsilon^*_i = \\epsilon_i / \\sigma_i\\), then it can be shown that \\(Var(\\epsilon^*_i)=1\\), i.e., constant. Under the usual OLS model: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N e_i^2=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(y_i-\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\cdot x_i \\right)^2\\] Under GLS model: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i e_i^2= \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\left(y_i-\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\cdot x_i \\right)^2\\] That is, GLS minimizes the weighted sum of the residual squares. Since in reality, the variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is not known, other techniques have to be employed to obtain so-called heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) standard errors. But first, two tests are introduced to detect heteroscedasticity. 8.1.1 Detecting Heteroscedasticity Two test are presented to detect heteroscedasticity: Goldfeld-Quandt Test (1965) Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey Test (1979) The steps necessary for the Goldfeld-Quandt Test are as follows: Sort observations by ascending order of the dependent variable. Pick C as the number of central observations to drop in the middle of the dependent variable. Run two separate regression equations, i.e., with the lower and upper part. Compute \\[\\lambda = \\frac{RSS_2/df}{RSS_1/df}\\] \\(\\lambda\\) follows an F-distribution. The Goldfeld-Quandt Test can be illustrated with gqtestdata. In a first step, the data is separated into two groups with \\(C=6\\). In a second step, both groups are used to run a regression. And lastly, \\(\\lambda\\) is calculated. gqtestdata1 = gqtestdata[1:22,] gqtestdata2 = gqtestdata[29:50,] bhat1 = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata1) bhat2 = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata2) lambda = sum(bhat2$residuals^2)/sum(bhat1$residuals^2) Of course, there is also a function in R called gqtest which simplifies the procedure. library(lmtest) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) gqtest(bhat,fraction = 6) ## ## Goldfeld-Quandt test ## ## data: bhat ## GQ = 7.7103, df1 = 20, df2 = 20, p-value = 1.368e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: variance increases from segment 1 to 2 In any case, the hypothesis of homoscedasticity is rejected for gqtestdata. The Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey Test is an alternative and does not rely on choosing C as the number of central observations to be dropped. The steps include the following: Run a regular OLS model and obtain the residuals. Calculate \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N e^2_i}{N}\\] Construct the variable \\(p_i\\) as follows: \\(p_i = e^2_i / \\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) Regress \\(p_i\\) on the Xs as follows \\[p_i = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\cdot x_{i1}+\\alpha_2 \\cdot x_{i2} + \\dots\\] Obtain the explained sum of squares (ESS) and define \\(\\Theta = 0.5 \\cdot ESS\\). Then \\(\\Theta \\sim \\chi^2_{m-1}\\). The much simpler procedure is to use the function bptest() in R. library(lmtest) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) bptest(bhat) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: bhat ## BP = 10.276, df = 1, p-value = 0.001348 8.1.2 Correcting Heteroscedasticity To correct for heteroscedasticity, robust standard errors must be obtained. library(sandwich) bhat = lm(price~sqft,data=gqtestdata) summary(bhat) vcov = vcovHC(bhat) coeftest(bhat,vcov.=vcov) Note that there are multiple variations to calculate the standard error and thus, it is possible for slight variations among the results from different packages. \\[Var(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2 e_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\] The square root of the following equation is called heteroscedastic robust standard error: \\[\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat{r}^2_{ij} e_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\] Standard errors can be either larger or smaller. Note that in this example, we do not know whether heteroscedasticity is present or not. "],["multicollinearity.html", "8.2 Multicollinearity", " 8.2 Multicollinearity Multicollinearity describes the situation in which two or more independent variables are linearly related. Under perfect multicollinearity: \\[\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2 + \\dots +\\lambda_k x_k = 0\\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) are constants that are not all zero simultaneously. For example, consider \\(x_1=\\{8,12,15,17\\}\\), \\(x_2=\\{24,36,45,51\\}\\), and \\(x_3=\\{2,3,3.75,4.25\\}\\). In this case, \\(\\lambda_1=1\\), \\(\\lambda_2=-1/5\\), and \\(\\lambda_3=2\\). Note, multicollinearity refers to linear relationships! Including a squared or cubed term is not an issue of multicollinearity. It can be shown that the variance of the estimator increases in the presence of multicollinearity. There are various indications that the data suffers from multicollinearity: High \\(R^2\\) but few significant variables Fail to reject the hypothesis for H\\(_0\\): \\(\\beta_i=0\\) based on t-values but rejection all slopes being simultaneously zero based on F-test. High correlation among explanatory variables Variation of statistically significant variables between models. 8.2.1 Variance Inflated Factors (VIF) Identifies possible correlation among multiple independent variables and not just two as in the case of a simple correlation coefficient. Consider the model: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\epsilon_i\\] The estimated variances of the coefficient \\(\\beta_k\\) is written as \\[Var(\\beta_k)^* = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{ik}-\\bar{x}_k)^2}\\] Without any multicollinearity, this variance is minimized. If some some independent variables are correlated with the independent variable \\(k\\), then \\[Var(\\beta_k) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{ik}-\\bar{x}_k)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-R^2_k}\\] where \\(R^2_k\\) is the \\(R^2\\) if variable \\(x_k\\) is taken as the dependent variable. The VIF can be written as \\[\\frac{Var(\\beta_k)}{Var(\\beta_k)^*}=\\frac{1}{1-R^2_k}\\] If \\(VIF=1\\), then there is no relationship between the variable \\(x_k\\) and the remaining independent variables. Otherwise, \\(VIF&gt;1\\). In general, the interpretation is as follows: VIF of 4 warrants attention VIF of 10 indicates a serious problem. 8.2.2 Examples To illustrate the concept of multicollinearity, the data set from nfl is used (Berri et al. (2011)). The first model includes total salary as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: prior season passing yards, pass attempts, experience (squared) in the league, draft round pick, veteran (more than 3 years in the league), pro bowl appearance, and facial symmetry. bhat = lm(log(total)~yards+att+exp+exp2+draft1+draft2+veteran+changeteam+pbowlever+symm,data=nfl) summary(bhat) After estimating the results, the function vif() from the package car is used: library(car) vif(bhat) ## yards att exp exp2 draft1 draft2 veteran changeteam pbowlever symm ## 32.547700 30.920282 39.889877 26.715342 1.621048 1.228091 5.253525 1.194254 1.581753 1.056661 The results indicate multicollinearity for yards, att, and experience.

The issue usually arises if there is a time component in the data. Recall the main types of data available for research: Cross-sectional data (multiple observations at same time point) Time series data (one variable observed over time) Pooled data (multiple observations at different time points) Panel data (same observations at different time points) There is a distinction between serial correlation and autocorrelation: Serial correlation: Correlation between two series Autocorrelation: Correlation with lagged variables The OLS estimator is still unbiased but there is no longer minimum variance since \\(E(\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j) \\neq 0\\). Autocorrelation is unlikely for cross-sectional data except in the case of spatial auto-correlation. One cause of autocorrelation could be inertia in economic variables. For example, variables such as income, production, or employment increase after a recession. But there are a number of other reasons for autocorrelation. Autocorrelation could be caused by specification bias due to excluded variables or incorrect functional forms.

For binary choice models, the outcome is interpreted as a probability, i.e., what is the probability of a person to answer yes to those questions. In the next chapter, the model is expanded to consider more than binary outcomes. Those models include categorical dependent variable that are either naturally ordered or have no ordering. Examples of naturally ordered categorical variables are: Level of happiness: Very happy, happy, ok, or sad. Intention to get a COIVID-19 vaccine: Definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, or definitely no Two examples about categorical dependent variable which have no ordering are: Commute to campus: Bike, car, walk, or bus Voter registration: Democrat, Republican, or independent For all those models, the outcome of interest is the probability to fall into a particular category. For binary choice models which are considered in this chapter, the outcome of interest is the probability to fall into the 1 (yes) category. For binary choice models, y takes one of two values: 0 or 1. And the model will specify \\(Pr(y=1|x)\\) where x are the independent variables. Consider the decision to purchase organic food. Assume that you have data about the income of respondents as well as information if they purchase organic food. The purchase decision (yes or no) is on the vertical axis and the income is on the horizontal axis. Remember that the probability has be bounded between 0 and 1. Hence, we need to find a function \\(G(z)\\) such that \\(0 \\leq G(z) \\leq 1\\) for all values of \\(z\\) and \\(P(y=1|x)=G(z)\\). Popular choices for \\(G(z)\\) are the cumulative normal distribution function (Probit Model) and the logistic function (Logit Model). For what follows, let \\(z=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k\\). For the probit model, \\(G(z)\\) is written as \\[Pr(y = 1) = G(z)=\\Phi(z)\\] where \\(\\Phi\\) represents the cumulative normal. And for the logit model, \\(G(z)\\) is written as \\[Pr(y = 1) = G(z)=\\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\\] The interpretation of the logit and probit estimates is not as straightforward as in the multivariate regression case. In general, we care about the effect of \\(x\\) on \\(P(y=1|x)\\). The sign of the coefficient shows the direction of the change in probability. The approximation to the marginal effect if \\(x\\) is roughly continuous: \\[\\Delta P(y=1|x) \\approx g(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + x \\cdot \\hat{\\beta}) \\cdot \\beta_j \\cdot \\Delta x_j\\] To obtain the marginal effects in R, an additional step is necessary. Let us illustrate the binary choice model using the data set organic and a logit model. The results of interest for the binary choice model are the (1) coefficient estimates, (2) marginal effects, and (3) predicted probabilities. "],["binary-choice-estimation-in-r.html", "9.1 Binary Choice Estimation in R", " 9.1 Binary Choice Estimation in R There are (at least) two possibilities to obtain the coefficient estimates in R. The first is using the built in R command glm(): bhat_glm_logit = glm(buying~income,family=binomial(link=&quot;logit&quot;),data=organic) summary(bhat_glm_logit) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = buying ~ income, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;), ## data = organic) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.8451 -0.5293 -0.1423 0.4093 1.9154 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The sign of the coefficient estimate for income is interpreted as the direction in which the probability changes. In this case, the coefficient is positive and thus, an increase (decrease) in income leads to an increase (decrease) in the probability of purchasing organic food. In addition, the coefficients are statistically significant. As aforementioned, the coefficients do not indicate the marginal effects though. To calculate the marginal effects, a slightly different approach is necessary. Let us first look at the second approach of obtaining the coefficient estimates and the R package mfx is required to do so. bhat = logitmfx(buying~income,data=organic) summary(bhat$fit) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = formula, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;), data = data, ## start = start, control = control, x = T) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.8451 -0.5293 -0.1423 0.4093 1.9154 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

To calculate the marginal effects at specific points, the command margins() must be used. Before, we used the command glm() to calculate the logit coefficients. The reason for using the glm() is that it allows us to calculate the predicted probabilities. Consider the example to purchase organic food and assume that there are three new respondents with income levels $25,000, $50,000, and $75,000. To predict the probability of those individuals purchasing organic food, the following functions can be used: datablock = data.frame(income=c(25,50,75)) predict(bhat_glm_logit,newdata=datablock,type=&quot;response&quot;) ## 1 2 3 ## 0.0498116 0.4946870 0.9481377 "],["additional-examples-and-probit-model.html", "9.2 Additional Examples and Probit Model", " 9.2 Additional Examples and Probit Model Here are two additional examples on working full-time and voting behavior.

For your model, interpret the R output and indicate why each independent variable that is included in the model would contribute to higher or lower happiness. Speak to the possibility of multicollinearity in the independent variables. Alternative Fuel Vehicle Choice: The data evdata contains data about the choice of consumers with respect to alternative fuel vehicles. For each consumer, you have the following variables: \\(age\\), \\(suv\\) (whether they are interested in buying a SUV), \\(level2\\) (indicating whether people have a fast charger for electric cars in their community), \\(own \\dots\\) (indicating whether the respondent currently has a gas, hybrid, plug- in hybrid, or battery electric vehicle), \\(gender\\) (1=female) and \\(numcars\\) (number of cars). Estimate a multinomial logit model that estimates the probability of a consumer to purchase a gasoline, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or battery electric vehicle. Calculate the marginal probabilities as well. NHTS: Consider the data set hhpub from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The data contains information about household characteristics and some of their travel means. For this question, you will focus on the following variables: \\(BIKE\\), \\(HBPPOPDN\\), \\(HHFAMINC\\), \\(HHVEHCNT\\), \\(HOMEOWN\\), and \\(URBRUR\\). You must read the codebook for this question and learn how the variables are coded. Go to the codebook and pick Household as the dataset (drop down menu). Before conducting the analysis, delete all entries that are not complete (i.e., all the negative values). Once you have final data set, estimate an ordered logit model with \\(BIKE\\) as the dependent variable and the other variables as the independent variables. What do you conclude from the model? Home heating: Consider the dataset Heating from the R package mlogit. You can load the data set into R by typing: data(\"Heating\",package=\"mlogit\"). The data contains the choice of heating systems in California homes. There are five types of heating systems: gas central (\\(gc\\)) gas room (\\(gr\\)) electric central (\\(ec\\)) electric room (\\(er\\)) heat pump (\\(hp\\)) There are 900 observations with the following variables: \\(idcase\\) gives the observation number (1-900), \\(depvar\\) identifies the chosen alternative (gc, gr, ec, er, hp), \\(ic.alt\\) is the installation cost for the 5 alternatives, \\(oc.alt\\) is the annual operating cost for the 5 alternatives, \\(income\\) is the annual income of the household, \\(agehed\\) is the age of the household head, \\(rooms\\) is the number of rooms in the house, \\(region\\) a factor with levels \\(ncostl\\) (northern coastal region), \\(scostl\\) (southern coastal region), \\(mountn\\) (mountain region), \\(valley\\) (central valley region). Estimate a multinomial logit model with installation and operating cost as the alternative-specific variables and income, age, and number of rooms as the individual-specific variables. "],["limited-dependent-variable-models.html", "11 Limited Dependent Variable Models", " 11 Limited Dependent Variable Models This chapter covers three regression models in which the dependent variable is somehow limited: Truncation: With truncated data, the researcher does not observe values past a particular point and those values are also not reported. Examples of truncation are low-income household studies, on-site visitation data, or time-of-use pricing experiments (excludes low-usage households). Censoring: In the case of censoring, values that are above or below a certain value are replaced by that value. For example, the demand for a particular class is not fully observed (absence of a waiting list). This is also called a Tobit model. Count dependent variable The following packages are necessary for this section: AER truncreg, censReg, and pscl. Truncation and censoring lead to a bias in the estimates. It is not always clear why or if the data is limited in its range. "],["truncation.html", "11.1 Truncation", " 11.1 Truncation In the case of truncation, a certain part of the data is not observed. In the graph below, the true parameters are \\(\\beta_0=-2\\) and \\(\\beta_1=0.5\\). Values \\(y&lt;0\\) are not reported in the data.

Here are some examples of count outcomes: What are the number of arrests for a person? What determines the number of credit cards a person owns? This section on count regression presents three models: Poisson Regression Model: The condition to use this model is the absence of overdispersion, i.e., the expected value of the dependent variable is equal to the variance. Quasi-Poisson Regression Model: Overdispersion occurs if the variance of the dependent variable is larger than its mean. In this case, the Poisson Regression Model leads to unreliable hypothesis tests regarding the coefficients. The Quasi-Poisson Model solves this issue. Negative Binomial Regression Model: The second possibility to deal with overdispersion is to use a Negative Binomial Regression Model. The main package used is pscl. There is also an additional resource with more theoretical details on the topic: Regression Models for Count Data in R. A more up-to-date version of the document may be found with the pscl package documentation. 11.3.1 Poisson Regression Model Recall that the Poisson distribution is written as: \\[Pr(Y=k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^k}{k!}\\] The important characteristics of the distribution is that the mean and variance are equal to \\(\\lambda\\), i.e., \\(E(Y)=\\lambda\\) and \\(Var(Y)=\\lambda\\), this is also known as the equidispersion property. The mean parameter is written as \\(\\lambda=exp(\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_1+ \\dots + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k)\\). The first examples uses the 2017 NHTS data contained in hhpub. In a first step, the data is prepared for the regression model, i.e., missing or unknown values are eliminated and income is measured in (thousand) dollar terms: hhpubdata = subset(hhpub,HHFAMINC %in% c(1:11) &amp; HOMEOWN %in% c(1,2) &amp; URBRUR %in% c(1,2) &amp; HHVEHCNT %in% c(0:12)) HHFAMINC = c(1:11) INCOME = c(10,12.5,20,30,42.5,57.5,82.5,112.5,137.5,175,200) INCOME = data.frame(HHFAMINC,INCOME) hhpubdata = merge(hhpubdata,INCOME) hhpubdata$RURAL = hhpubdata$URBRUR-1 hhpubdata$RENT = hhpubdata$HOMEOWN-1 The outcome of interest is the number of vehicles based on household income, home ownership, and urban/rural household location. Before executing the Poisson regression model, calculate the mean and variance of the outcome variable. ## [1] 1.981142 ## [1] 1.386027 The mean and the variance are similar and thus, estimating a Poisson Regression Model is an appropriate first step. The package AER also contains the function dispersiontest() which conducts a hypothesis test assuming no overdispersion. This test will be used after execution of the main regression. To estimate the model, the glm() function can be used by specifying family=poisson. bhat_pois = glm(HHVEHCNT~INCOME+RENT+RURAL,data=hhpubdata,family=poisson) summary(bhat_pois) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = HHVEHCNT ~ INCOME + RENT + RURAL, family = poisson, ## data = hhpubdata) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.6889 -0.5568 -0.1558 0.3590 5.5063 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The signs associated with the coefficients indicates the direction of influence on the outcome variable, i.e., the number of cars. As expected, higher income is associated with a higher number of cars and so is living in a rural environment. Renting is associated with a lower number of vehicles. Note that income and renting is possibly correlated. In general, the coefficient estimates are interpreted using \\(\\exp(\\beta)\\). That is, with every unit increase in \\(X\\), the predictor variable has a multiplicative effect of \\(\\exp(\\beta)\\) on the mean of \\(Y\\), i.e., \\(\\lambda\\): If \\(\\beta=0\\), then \\(\\exp(\\beta) = 1\\), and the expected count \\(\\mu= E(y) = \\exp(\\alpha)\\), and Y and X are not related. If \\(\\beta&gt;0\\), then \\(\\exp(\\beta) &gt; 1\\), and the expected count \\(E(y)\\) is \\(\\exp(\\beta)\\) times larger than when \\(X = 0\\) If \\(\\beta&lt;0\\), then \\(\\exp(\\beta) &lt; 1\\), and the expected count \\(E(y)\\) is \\(\\exp(\\beta)\\) times smaller than when \\(X = 0\\) The function overdispersion tests the null hypothesis of equidispersion: dispersiontest(bhat_pois) ## ## Overdispersion test ## ## data: bhat_pois ## z = -115.75, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true dispersion is greater than 1 ## sample estimates: ## dispersion ## 0.5670593 Given the p-value, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If the data suggests overdispersion, two alternative regression models can be used: (1) Quasi-Poisson and (2) Negative Binomial. 11.3.2 Quasi-Poisson Regression Model The dataset blm used in this section as well as the one describing the negative binomial model is associated with the article Black Lives Matter: Evidence that Police-Caused Deaths Predict Protest Activity. Note that the paper includes a significant number of supplementary materials which allows for the replication of the results and much more. The dependent variable is the total number of protests in a city.

So far, only cross-sectional data was analyzed. This chapter on panel data starts to incorporate time aspects into the estimation procedure. The required packages are plm and lmtest. The plm also contains some excellent documentation on the theoretical aspects of panel data as well as on the use of the package. "],["overview-1.html", "12.1 Overview", " 12.1 Overview Two types of data must be distinguished: Pooled data: Combination of multiple cross-sectional data over time Two or more different observational units over time Grades in an economics class based on students concentration combined from multiple semesters American Community Survey (ACS) Panel data: Repeated measurement on the same individual \\(i\\) over time \\(t\\). Individual units can be people, states, firms, counties, countries, etc. National Longitudinal Survey (NLSY79): To access the data: Accessing Data &gt; Investigator &gt; Begin searching as guest. Necessary adjustments of standard error due to correlation across time. There are some necessary assumptions about linear panel models. Regular time intervals Errors are correlated Parameters may vary across individuals or time Intercept: Individual specific effects model (fixed or random) Note that the General Social Survey (GSS) is not a panel data set because different respondents are questioned every year. Besides the National Longitudinal Survey mentioned above, here are some additional examples of panel data sets: Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID): Data on approximately 5,000 families on various socioeconomic and demographic variables Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP): Interviews about economic condition of respondents Panel models have the advantage that they take into account heterogeneity among observational units, e.g., firms, states, counties. Those models also contribute to the better understanding on the dynamics of change for observational units over time. Panel data combines cross-sectional data with time series data leading to more complete behavioral models. Balanced versus unbalance panel: A balanced panel has the same number of time-series observations for each subject or observational unit, whereas an unbalanced panel does not. Short versus long panel: A short panel has a larger number of subjects or observational units than there are time periods. A long panel has a greater number of time periods than observational units.

The regression equation can be written as: \\[inv_{it} = \\beta_{0i} + \\beta_1 \\cdot value_{it} + \\beta_2 \\cdot capital_{it}\\] where \\(i\\) and \\(t\\) represent the firms and time, respectively. This model can also be written as \\[inv_{it} = \\alpha_0+\\alpha_1 \\cdot D_{1i} + \\alpha_2 \\cdot D_{2i} +\\alpha_3 \\cdot D_{3i} + \\beta_1 \\cdot value_{it} + \\beta_2 \\cdot capital_{it}\\] Individual specific effects: \\[y_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i \\cdot x_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}\\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) can be fixed or random. The companies of interest for this chapter are GM (firm 1), U.S. Steel (firm 2), GE (firm 3), and Westinghouse (firm 8). grunfeld = subset(grunfeld,grunfeld$firm %in% c(1,2,3,8)) In a first step, a pooled model is executed, i.e., all cross-sectional and time series observations are combined into a single data set. \\[inv_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot value_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot capital_i\\] The general formulation of the pooled model: \\[y_{it}=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] There are multiple issues associated with a pooled OLS model: Ignores heterogeneity among the observations and time. Presence of heterogeneity: Correlation between independent variables and error term leads to biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates. Solution: Fixed effects model takes heterogeneity into account. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Autocorrelation between error terms. Fix: Random effects model To use the functions from plm, define the data as a panel data set: grunfeld = pdata.frame(grunfeld,index=c(&quot;firm&quot;,&quot;year&quot;)) There are two possibilities to execute a pooled OLS Model.

On the other hand, more guns trickling into society increase the likelihood of crime being committed. This data set is one example on how the issue at hand can be analyzed.

Times series represent a temporal ordering of the data. In the cross-section models seen so far, the observations could have been in any order. In this chapter, the ordering of the observations matters. It is usually assumed that there is a stochastic process generating the series and the important aspect is that only a single realization of the stochastic process is observed. The following topics are covered: Trend and seasonality Finite distributed lag models (including past or lagged independent variables) Autoregressive model (including past or lagged dependent variables) also known as dynamic models: Forecasting The static regression model is presented before moving into proper time series analysis. The model is used if the data represents various time periods but the independent variables \\(x_{i,t}\\) have an immediate effect on the dependent variable \\(y_t\\).

The sales volume in the shop fluctuates with the number of tourists which are in town. A larger number of tourists is observed in December for the holiday season and for the local surfing festival in March. Over the years, the shop has expanded in terms of items offered and also in store area. Plot the data. What do you observe in terms of trend, seasonality, and magnitude of fluctuations? Estimate a regular OLS Model with \\(sales\\) as the dependent variable and a trend as well as monthly dummy variables as independent variables. Plot the observed sales and predicted sales over time. Repeat the estimation and the plot from (b) and (c) but use the natural log of \\(sales\\), i.e., $(sales), as the dependent variable instead. Compare the two graphs you have generated. What is the difference and what is the reason for the difference? Which form of the dependent variable is more appropriate.
