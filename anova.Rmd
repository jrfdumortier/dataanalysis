# ANOVA
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models (also know as Dummy Variable Regression models) are regressions with only dummy variables. An ANOVA model with two independent variables can be written as follows:
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot d_1 + \beta_2 \cdot d_2$$
where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are dummy variables. Consider the following model using the `nfl` data for the year 2005:
$$total = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot draft1 + \beta_2 \cdot veteran$$
where *draft1* and *veteran* are dummy variables. That is, if $draft1=1$, then the player was selected in the first draft round. If $veteran=1$, then the player has played multiple seasons in the NFL. To distinguish *j* categories only *j-1* dummy variables are needed. Otherwise, we have perfect multicollinearity. The category without a dummy variable is the base category.
```{r}
bhat = lm(total~draft1+veteran,data=subset(nfl,year=2005))
summary(bhat)
```
For a player who was not drafted in the first round and is not a veteran, the income is close to $1 million. Note that both dummy variables are statistically significant. Note that the R-squared is very low.  

## Exercises
1. ***Indy Homes II*** (\*\*)Consider the data in `indyhomes`. A real estate agent once mentioned that homes built in the eighties are of lower quality and thus, are cheaper. One possibility to asses this claim is with an ANOVA model. Add three new dummy variables to the data frame: eighties (equal to 1 if the home was built in any year between 1980 to 1989), northwest (equal to 1 if the home is in the 46268 ZIP code), and singlestory (equal to 1 if the home has one story). Estimate the following ANOVA model:
$$price = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot d_{80s}+\beta_2 \cdot d_{northwest} + \beta_3 \cdot d_{single}$$
What do you conclude? Next, add square footage to the model. What has changed in terms of coefficients? How do you interpret that change?
