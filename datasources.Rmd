# Data Sources
This chapter describes the functions and data sets associated with the lecture notes which are contained in the file [DataAnalysisPAData.RData](https://github.com/jrfdumortier/dataanalysis/blob/master/DataAnalysisPAData.RData).

The following functions are included:

- `bday(k)`: This function calculates the probability of two people having the same birthday in a group of $k$ people.
- `samplesize(me,p=0.5,pop)`: This function requires the desired margin of error as the input, e.g., $me=0.03$ for $\pm 3\%$. By default, the function calculates the sample size assuming a variance maximizing probability of $p=0.5$ and infinite population. Both parameters can be adjusted.

Some data sets are generic, i.e., randomly generated, to highlight a particular concept while other are either based on public sources or are taken from academic papers. In any case, the sources are clearly indicated. Sometimes modifications were made to the data for ease of use, e.g., removing missing values or unnecessary variables.
