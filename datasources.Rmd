# Data Sources

This chapter describes the data sets associated with the lecture notes. Some data sets are generic, i.e., randomly generated, to highlight a particular concept while other are either based on public sources or are taken from academic papers. In any case, the source is clearly indicated. Sometimes modifications were made to the  data sets for ease of use, e.g., removing missing values. All the data are contained in the file [DataAnalysisPAData.RData](https://github.com/jrfdumortier/dataanalysis/blob/master/DataAnalysisPAData.RData). Some of the data are also associated with specific R packages which is indicated.
