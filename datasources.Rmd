# Data Sources

This chapter describes the data sets associated with the lecture notes. Some data sets are generic, i.e., randomly generated, to highlight a particular concept while other are either based on public sources or are taken from academic papers. In any case, the sources are clearly indicated. Sometimes modifications were made to the data for ease of use, e.g., removing missing values or unnecessary variables. All the data is contained in the file [DataAnalysisPAData.RData](https://github.com/jrfdumortier/dataanalysis/blob/master/DataAnalysisPAData.RData). Some of the data sets are also associated with specific R packages which is indicated.
